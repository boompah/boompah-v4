<h3>About</h3>

<p>I’m a passionate UI/UX designer with over 6 years of experience and a belief that design is about creating things that matter. My career has been a pursuit of constant improvement, humility, empathy, and embracing design challenges. I've worked with amazing clients all over the Canada and the U.S.</p>

<p>As well as an active hands-on designer, I’m a passionate ui developer – both small and at scale - with my own design driven approach. I believe in creating awesome user experiences, healthy relationships, disruptive and challenging methodologies, and an environment that is sensitive and respectful of creative energy, inspiration and health.</p>

<p>I excel in delivering wireframes, prototypes, finalized visual design, HTML, CSS and JS.</p>
