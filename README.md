<h1>Boompah v4</h1>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Boompah is my online playground and I thought it'd be fun to take a different approach to its creation. The first step was to kick out Wordpress and experiment with raw html, css and a pinch of PHP. I'm using Skeleton as a base right now for my responsiveness, I enjoy using a familiar CSS framework. My plan is to use Google Custom search, intense debate and twitter and facebook tools for the blog. Aside from that, I'm going to keep playing around and see where this takes me.</p>
