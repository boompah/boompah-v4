      <h2 class="main-name">Ryan Bollenbach</h2>
      <p>I’m a passionate UI/UX designer with over 6 years of experience and a belief that design is about creating things that matter. My career has been a pursuit of constant improvement, humility, empathy, and embracing design challenges. I've worked with amazing clients all over the Canada and the U.S.</p>
      <p>As well as an active hands-on designer, I’m a passionate ui developer – both small and at scale - with my own design driven approach. I believe in creating awesome user experiences, healthy relationships, disruptive and challenging methodologies, and an environment that is sensitive and respectful of creative energy, inspiration and health.</p>
      <p>I excel in delivering wireframes, prototypes, finalized visual design, HTML, CSS and JS.</p>

          <p>"Ryan is a recent addition to the Tungle team. Since joining he has had a big impact. He quickly integrated into our dev team and established a solid design and front end function from nothing (before him we outsourced this). He works quickly and can take high level concepts and translate them into well
          executed wireframes and images. He is a valuable member of our team."</p>
