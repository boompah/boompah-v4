        <p>"Ryan is a recent addition to the Tungle team. Since joining he has had a big impact. He quickly integrated into our dev team and established a solid design and front end function from nothing (before him we outsourced this). He works quickly and can take high level concepts and translate them into well
        executed wireframes and images. He is a valuable member of our team."</p>
