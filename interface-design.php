      <h3>Wireframes &amp; Prototypes</h3>
      <p>We believe wireframes are the most powerful when conceptualizing interface designs. We prefer vector based wireframes created in Adobe Illustrator when the goal involves exploring drastically different compositions. If the composition’s direction is decided and game plan involves quick prototyping with responsive web design, we reccomend responsive HTML based wireframes.</p>

      <h3>Boutique Websites</h3>
      <p>From our experience of working with several brands in fashion, we’ve adapted to what we call the “boutique design language”. In short, this means creating classy, timliness layouts with clean graphic design, a nice balance of white space and elegant typography.</p>
      <p>We're very passionate about this approach on many levels. We believe it creates a more specialized apperence, it works well on several budget ranges and adapts to the growth of just about any brand. Boompah.com is a prime example of a boutique website.</p>
