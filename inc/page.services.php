      <h3>Responsive Web Design</h3>
      <p>We're constantly refining our responsive web design process, adapting to its steady evolution. Whether it’s a brochure website or intensive web application, we have extensive experience with various ui patterns.</p>
      <p>We enjoy rocking out with <a href="http://neat.bourbon.io/" title="Bourbon Neat" target="_blank">Neat</a>, <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/" title="Twitter's Bootstrap" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, and a select handful of responsive frameworks. We also create custom grids and media query architectures from scratch. Our favourite mobile device to design for currently is the Samsung S4.</p>

      <h3>Web Application Design</h3>
      <p>Working on a web app is the ability to zoom in on a single page element, explore all its states, define its purpose in a workflow while establishing the anatomy of a website. We solve complex usability issues, develop new ideas for functionality and make interfaces pleasurable to use.</p>
      <p>We've worked on several large scale web apps including advanced calendar software, medical prescriptions organizations, MLS systems and more. We love solving complex design problems.</p>

      <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
      <p>We recommend usability testing at different stages of a project depending on the circumstances. Testing helps to address usability issues when beginning a project or help solidfy decisions on an element we've implemented.</p>
      <p>Our main focus has involved testing payment processes, login and signup forms, task workflows and mobile feedback. We enjoy using <a href="http://www.usertesting.com/" title="UserTesting.com" target="_blank">UserTesting.com</a>, <a href="http://www.crazyegg.com/" title="Crazy Egg" target="_blank">Crazy Egg</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" title="Google Analytics" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>, <a href="http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com/" title="Visual Website Optimizer" target="_blank">Visual Website Optimizer</a>, etc.</p>

      <h3>Wireframes &amp; Prototypes</h3>
      <p>Wireframes are a powerful way conceptualize layouts and quickly iterate. We prefer vector based wireframes created in Adobe’s Illustrator when the goal involves exploring drastically different compositions. We also enjoy <a href="http://www.mockflow.com/" title="Mockflow" target="_blank">Mockflow</a>, <a href="http://uxpin.com/" title="UXPin" target="_blank">UXPin</a>, and <a href="https://gomockingbird.com/" title="Mockingbird" target="_blank">Mockingbird</a>.</p>
      <p>If the composition’s direction is decided and game plan involves quick prototyping with responsive web design, we recommend responsive HTML based wireframes. 
        To test out more developed ui's before the final design phase we work with tools like <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/" title="InVision" target="_blank">InVision</a>,
         <a href="http://maker.github.io/ratchet/" title="Ratchet" target="_blank">Ratchet</a>, <a href="http://jaunesarmiento.me/fries/" title="Fries" target="_blank">Fries</a>, and <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" title="Foundation" target="_blank">Foundation</a>.
