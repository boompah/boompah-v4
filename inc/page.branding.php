      <h3>Social Media Science</h3>
      <p>We approach social media quite differently than what we've been seeing in the wild. We do the grunt work in hunting down an audience that’s related to your market, location and demographic. We listen more than we tweet and ask questions instead of only stuffing ads in people’s feeds.</p>
      <p>We use various tools for automation and <em>*make the internet work for us*</em>. We establish an agile high level strategy, community directory and track everything with actionable items to grow. We also guide brands through contests, content activations and grassroots campaigns.</p>

      <h3>Media Kits</h3>
      <p>From our history of working with sales associates, we understand the value of creating an outstanding media kit to close new deals with your potential clients.</p>
      <p>Creating an interactive PDF is an excellent way to create a personalized, private experience that will easily work on a ton of devices and screen sizes. Best of all, it’s optimized to print should the need arise.</p>

      <h3>Logo Design</h3>
      <p>A logo is the first step to creating a memorable brand. We can walk you through the process of of assessing the goals and needs of a logo, then create a roadmap of how to approach it. We do not use a fixed process when designs logos but, we try to ask the important questions.</p>

      <h3>Print Media</h3>
      <p>Our primary focus is digital but anything we create can be translated to print collatoral should the need arise.</p>   
      <p>Print remains an essential asset to advertise your brand in a physical experience. When you’re at the golf course chatting with a potential client, making a lasting first impression with a business card could be the defining factor in closing.</p>
