      <h3>Style Guides</h3>
      <p>These days there are several different definitions of a brand style guide and it’s important to keep in mind so your brand stays consistent. Since the majority of marketing is online based, it only makes sense to have a style guide that maps out your online presence.</p>
      <p>Whether you have an existing website or worked with us on a new or re-designed site, we will document all the characteristics of your brand. This includes specific HTML assets, colour values, typography &amp; fonts, content layouts, forms, graphic styles, responsive web design considerations.</p>
      <p>The beauty of a style guide is the ability to have multiple designers work on a project while speaking the same language of a brand.</p>

      <h3>Social Media Science</h3>
      <p>We approach social media quite differently than what we've been seeing in the wild. We do not want to be anyone's cheerleader, we create meaningful interactions. We do the grunt work in hunting down an audience that’s related to your market, location and demographic. We listen more than we tweet and ask questions instead of only stuffing ads in people’s feeds.</p>
      <p>We use various tools for automation and <em>*make the internet work for us*</em>. We establish an agile high level strategy, community directory and track everything with actionable items to grow. We also guide brands through contests, content activations and grassroots campaigns.</p>

      <h3>Logo Design</h3>
      <p>A logo is the first step to creating a memorable brand. We can walk you through the process of of assessing the goals and needs of a logo, then create a roadmap of how to approach it. We do not use a fixed process when designs logos but, we try to ask the right questions.</p>
      <p>What styles of logos and brands inspire you?<br />
      What do you want the logo to communicate?<br />
      What fonts do you enjoy?<br />
      What colours do you enjoy?<br />
      If you already have a logo, what do you aim to improve upon?<br />
      What is your target audience?</p>

      <h3>Print Media</h3>
      <p>Business cards will always remain an essential asset to advertise your brand at a one on one level. When you’re at the golf course chatting with a potential client, making a lasting first impression could be the difference between landing a new lead or losing brand respect.</p>
      <p>We believe it’s good to stay classy but think outside of the box when designing business cards. We’ll ensure brand consistency with your website and help you put your best step forward.</p>
      <p>We’re affiliated with international and local (Winnipeg, MB) printers to ensure your business cards will be delivered to your doorstep.</p>
