      <h3>Style Guides</h3>
      <p>These days there are several different definitions of a brand style guide and it’s important to keep in mind so your brand stays consistent. Since the majority of marketing is online based, it only makes sense to have a style guide that maps out your online presence.</p>

This includes specific HTML assets, colour values, typography &amp; fonts, content layouts, forms, graphic styles, responsive web design considerations.</p>
      <p>The beauty of a style guide is the ability to have multiple designers work on a project while speaking the same language of a brand.</p>
