<h1>Skullcandy</h1>

<p>Throughout the process of locking in a new full time gig, one of the companies that interviewed me was <a title="Skullcandy" href="http://skullcandy.com" target="_blank">Skullcandy</a>. Skullcandy was founded by Rick Alden in 2003 and they're currently headquartered in Park City, Utah. They specialize in various types of headphones but also sell backpacks, clothes, and iPhone accessories. They do a ton of awesome campaigns and recently signed <a title="Skullcandy's Take a Supermodel to Work: Episode 1 - Kate Upton, Kevin Durant, James Harden" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7hPAgN3hP8&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">Kate Upton</a>. Skullcandy also recently acquired <a title="Astro Gaming" href="http://astrogaming.com" target="_blank">Astro Gaming</a> which specializes in professional gaming headsets used in world renowned competitions like <a title="Major League Gaming" href="http://www.majorleaguegaming.com/" target="_blank">MLG</a>.</p>

<p>I had the privilege of being flown down to Salt Lake City for the interview to meet the team in person and it was an incredible experience. Utah is absolutely beautiful and Park City is a newly discovered gem for me. Utah is very well known for its world class skiing, snowboarding and golf courses. The people are very kind, low crime rates and the city is quite clean.</p>

<p>One of the tasks I completed during the interview was a re-design of Skullcandy's home page.</p>

<p><strong>This is what the site currently looks like</strong></p>

<strong>Here are some issues I had with the existing layout</strong>
<ol>
	<li>I didn't feel like the social icons in the main navigation blended into the the rest of the site.</li>
	<li>The navigation items text are a touch too big, especially for growth.</li>
	<li>Something about the Login / Support / Cart menu looks a bit rushed.</li>
	<li>There's too much attention given to the search box, I felt its presence could be turned down a notch.</li>
	<li>The white background on the Eric Koston promo doesn't blend well into the rest of the design. It might help to stretch the white across the entire width of the browser and extend it to the height of the promo.</li>
	<li>The home page has no main call to actions for products, I felt that it could benefit from this.</li>
	<li>The two initial photo images were slightly too uninformative, I didn't know what they were for.</li>
	<li>I'm not a fan of the What is Skullcandy Supreme sound youtube embed. I felt this area could use a catchier graphic and open up a nice modal for the video.</li>
	<li>I felt the Follow Skullcandy for twitter updates on the home page could be removed. It's my preference and I can understand why people enjoy them. I personally have never read a twitter feed on a website, I use twitter for reading tweets which I could assume is a common mental model.</li>
	<li>The team section should have Kate Upton present somehow. She's a beautiful women and photos of hot chicks will generally help conversion.</li>
	<li>I felt like the mobile apps were squished into the corner and could take advantage of more attention. I wanted to make this element more visual and allow the user to easily download each app.</li>
	<li>I didn't feel like the wallpapers were up to the Skullcandy level of quality. The Kate Upton one looks hot but there's currently only one size. It's important to offer HD and mobile sizes for extended reach.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Here is my re-design</strong>

<a title="Skullcandy - Home Re-design" href="http://boompah.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/019-Home-Redesign.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-846" title="019-Skullcandy-Redesign" src="http://boompah.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/019-Skullcandy-Redesign.jpg" alt="" width="732" height="1935" /></a>

<p>Rather than trying to reinvent Skullcandy's branding and approach to their home page, I focused on the items above to provide a solution to test out some new ideas. I really enjoyed playing around with Skullcandy's branding and I think it's a great foundation to build on top of in many different directions.</p>

<P>Thank you to everyone at Skullcandy for making this experience possible. Although we didn't land up moving forward with this lead UX position, I'm very grateful to have been considered.</p>
