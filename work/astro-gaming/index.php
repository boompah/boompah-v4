<p>To follow up from my previous article, <a title="Case Study – Skullcandy Home Page" href="http://boompah.com/2012/06/23/case-study-skullcandy-home-page/" target="_blank">Case Study – Skullcandy Home Page</a> another interview I recently had was with <a title="Astro Gaming" href="http://astrogaming.com/" target="_blank">Astro Gaming</a>. They specialize in high-end headsets for gamers <em>"The Ferrari of gaming headsets"</em>. The Astro Gaming A40 Audio System is the official headset of the <a href="http://www.majorleaguegaming.com/" target="_blank">MLG</a> Pro Circuit. Before meeting up with Jordan Reiss and Aaron Drayer for my interview in person, I thought it'd be useful to explore Astro Gaming's branding and play around with some ideas that might improve the overall experience of their store front.</p>

<p>Unfortunately since Astro recently released their new site design, I was unable to reference the previous layout which mine was based off of. I don't see this being too much of an issue as our ideas are still somewhat different.</p>

<p><strong>Here is my Astro Gaming home page layout</strong></p>

<a title="Astro Gaming Home Page" href="http://boompah.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/020-Astro-Gaming-full.jpg"><img class="scale-with-grid" title="Astro Gaming - Home Re-design" src="http://boompah.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/020-Astro-Gaming.jpg" alt="Astro Gaming - Home Re-design" /></a>

<strong>What I addressed in this layout</strong>
<ol>
	<li>For an e-commerce site, I felt the existing layout was too dark, I went for a lighter approach.</li>
	<li>I tried to polish up the navigation and made it more apart of the main promotion's environment.</li>
	<li>I added in the featured products section which has some similarities to my Skullcandy layout. This approach doesn't display prices and I'm curious if it would have an impact on conversion. Apart of me is tied to the mental model that people want to know prices ASAP when buying something. At the same time, not displaying the price may inspire users to click through to the product page which they may not have done having known the price. This could be an opportunity to encourage users to learn more about features and other information related to the product. This would be interesting to test.</li>
	<li>I blew out the footer making it easier to check out different social channels and popular items.</li>

<p>I recently got a set of the <a title="Astro Gaming - A40" href="http://www.astrogaming.com/a40-audio-system-astro-edition" target="_blank">A40</a>'s and it's the best headset I've ever used. The Mix Amp is so handy for controlling the volume of your voice and it's important to hear yourself in a good headset. I found I was forced to use my previous headphones like a DJ because they were noise cancelling. Beyond gaming, I also use my A40's as my everyday music headphones.</p>
