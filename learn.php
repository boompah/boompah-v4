  <h1>Learn Something New Everyday</h1>
  <p> On July 6th 2014 I decided to take on the challenge to learn something new everyday for one year <em>(at least).</em> Regardless of how big or small, I'm using this page to track articles I read and things I learn. In parallel to learning, I plan to implement things I learn into the development of this site! Fun stuff.</p>
